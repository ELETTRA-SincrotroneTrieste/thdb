release_1_0_4:

    Fixes and extends the functionalities introduced in 1.0.3, now specializing the
    queries for read only and read write attributes data retrieval.
    If no data is stored between the desired start and stop date, then the database
    is looked for the latest available data preceding the desired start date. When found,
    the start date is set equal to the desired start date and the latest available data
    is automatically associated to the desired start date.

    private/queries/attidquery.h:
    private/queries/idinfo.cpp:
    private/queries/attidquery.cpp: separate management of read only/read write attributes

    private/queries/datainfo.cpp: looks back into the database for the latest available data,
                                  changing the start date according to the desired start date
                                  and setting the value to the latest available value preceding
                                  the desired start date.

    private/queries/scalarnumbersquery.cpp: when creating DataInfo, sets the writable boolean flag
                                            in order to specialize the query for read only and
                                            read write attributes.
release_1_0_3:

Relevant changes:

1.    private/queries/datainfo.cpp: changed query from:
         "SELECT * FROM att_%1 WHERE time >= '%2' AND time <= '%3'"
    to:
        "SELECT * FROM att_%1 WHERE time >= '%2' AND time <= '%3' "
        " UNION (SELECT * FROM att_%1 WHERE time < '%2' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY time"

     If there is no data in the time interval specified, then this query retrieves the first
     available value in the history, looking back before the start date.

2.     private/queries/sourceslistquery.cpp: changed query from:
        "select adt.full_name from adt,apt where apt.ID=adt.ID"
     to:
        "select adt.full_name from adt,apt where apt.ID=adt.ID ORDER BY adt.full_name"

3. widgets: added drag drop. Some other changes.

4. Added THdbViewer application to utils/thdb distribution.

release_1_0_2: MYSQL_OPT_RECONNECT=1 to enable database reconnection.

release_1_0_1: first release installed. Used by saverestore.
